    <h2>What is N Back</h2>
    <p>N Back is a brain training game for improving various cognitive abilities, such as multi-dimensional thinking, memory, processing speed, and pretty much every important cognitive ability for overall intelligence</p>
    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <p>In normal N Back, you have a 3x3 grid, and in a random cell is gonna be shown a stimuli every delay interval. the stimuli can be composed of dimensions such as position, color, character, etc.. and every time the stimuli appear, you have to click the button of the stimuli which are the same as N delay intervals ago</p>
    <h2>3D Delta N Back</h2>
    <p>3D Delta N Back was developed by hglf in early Octomber 2024. It uses a 3x3x3 cube for the stimuli instead of the 3x3 grid you'd find in most other N Back apps. It also has up to 9 types of stimuli: Position, Cell, Color, Size, Character(Char), Word, Word Size(W-Size), Character Color(C-Color).</p>
    <p>Here, Position is the cell of the character. Cell is the cell thats filled with color. Color is color of the cell thats filled with color. Size is size of the character. Character is the character displayed in the character cell. Word is the word displayed in the cell thats filled with color. word size is the size of the word. character color is the color of the character</p>
    <h3>Difference mode</h3>
    <p>In difference mode, you check for different stimuli instead of same as N intervals ago</p>
